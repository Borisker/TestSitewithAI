            <p>I'm glad to meet you on my site. Who am I and how I can be helpful for you?</p>
            <p>About Me</p>
            <p>I’m Boris Lushkin, a results-driven Product Manager with over four years of experience in managing the entire product lifecycle—from ideation to launch. I specialize in leading cross-functional teams, developing customer-centric solutions, and delivering measurable business outcomes. Prior to transitioning into product management, I spent several years as a QA Engineer, which gives me a strong technical foundation and a proactive approach to solving problems. Currently, I’m focusing on delivering innovative products for diverse industries, with a particular passion for mobile applications and improving user experiences. Throughout my career, I've been involved in several successful projects, including launching a new B2B product line that generated over $10,000 in monthly recurring revenue. I’m also experienced in creating MVPs, managing agile workflows, and ensuring product-market fit through customer feedback and user interviews. In addition to my professional experience, I have a deep passion for motorcycles. I’ve been involved in motorcycling for over 15 years, including riding, maintenance, racing, and training riders. I actively contribute to organizing events and preparing athletes for competitions. This passion for motorsports not only drives my personal interests but also helps me bring an innovative and competitive mindset to my professional life.</p>
